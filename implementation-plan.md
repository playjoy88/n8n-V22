## Environment Analysis

The current environment consists of:

1. **Coolify Platform**: A self-hosted container deployment platform (version 4.0.0-beta.418) that manages the services, with its PostgreSQL database and Redis for caching.

2. **Traefik**: Acting as a reverse proxy, handling routing and SSL certificates.

3. **n8n Instance**: A workflow automation tool already running and accessible at https://n8n.ipthai.top.

4. **Gitea with PostgreSQL**: A Git service with its database, accessible at n8n-backend.ipthai.top.

## n8nThai Platform Implementation Strategy

Based on the blueprint, we need to develop a multi-tenant n8n hosting platform with Thai-specific features. Here's the implementation strategy:

### Phase 1: Platform Foundation

1. **Development Setup**
   - Create a Next.js application that will serve as the front-end and API backend for the platform
   - Set up the database schema as specified in the blueprint using Prisma ORM
   - Implement basic authentication and user management

2. **Infrastructure Preparation**
   - Set up Kubernetes cluster for orchestrating n8n instances
   - Configure S3-compatible storage for backups
   - Prepare monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)

### Phase 2: Core Features

1. **User Management System**
   - Implement user registration with email verification
   - Set up JWT authentication
   - Create user roles and profile management
   - Implement Thai language support

2. **Instance Management**
   - Develop APIs to create, start, stop, and restart n8n instances
   - Implement resource allocation based on subscription plans
   - Set up domain/subdomain management
   - Create instance health checks and monitoring

3. **Subscription Plans**
   - Implement plan tiers (Free trial, Starter, Pro, Enterprise)
   - Set up plan upgrade/downgrade functionality
   - Create automatic renewal and billing processes

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

1. **Payment System**
   - Integrate with Omise payment gateway
   - Implement support for Thai payment methods (QR code/PromptPay)
   - Create invoice and receipt generation (Thai tax format)

2. **Backup System**
   - Implement automated scheduled backups
   - Create backup frequency based on subscription plan
   - Develop one-click restoration

3. **Admin Dashboard System**
   - Build comprehensive system overview and statistics
   - Implement user management for admins
   - Create instance monitoring and management tools
   - Develop system performance metrics dashboards

4. **Support Ticket System**
   - Create ticket creation interface
   - Implement ticket status tracking and notifications
   - Develop in-app messaging for ticket replies

5. **System Monitoring**
   - Set up real-time server performance dashboards
   - Implement resource utilization monitoring
   - Create automated alerts for critical issues

6. **Audit Logging**
   - Implement comprehensive tracking of administrative actions
   - Create searchable and filterable log interface
   - Set up secure storage of audit data

7. **Analytics and Reporting**
   - Implement user growth and retention analytics
   - Create revenue and subscription metrics
   - Develop custom report builder for administrators

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend

- Next.js for server-side rendering
- React for component-based UI
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Bilingual support (Thai/English)
- Responsive design for all devices
- Context API for state management
- SWR for data fetching with caching
- React Hook Form for form validation

### Backend

- Next.js API routes
- Prisma ORM for database operations
- PostgreSQL for primary database
- Redis for caching and session management
- JWT for authentication
- Express middleware for specific routes
- Bull for background job processing
- Node.js event-driven architecture

### Infrastructure

- Docker containers for n8n instances
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- NGINX for reverse proxy and load balancing
- Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates
- AWS S3 for backup storage
- AWS CloudFront for CDN
- AWS RDS for managed PostgreSQL
- Terraform for infrastructure as code
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Security

- HTTPS for all connections
- JWT with refresh tokens
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Rate limiting
- DDoS protection
- Regular security audits
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- IP-based access restrictions for admin
- Two-factor authentication for sensitive areas
- Automated vulnerability scanning

## Next Steps

1. Set up the development environment
2. Create the initial Next.js application
3. Implement the database schema with Prisma
4. Develop authentication and user management
5. Begin implementation of the instance management system

This plan will be updated as progress is made and more detailed requirements are defined.
